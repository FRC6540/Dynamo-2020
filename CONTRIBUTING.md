# Contributing!

## IMPORTANT! Do NOT commit to master.
  Master is reserved for final versions of the code. That is what will be deployed to the robot. Only fully tested code will be accepted in Master.
  
  
  When editing code, keep track of the changes you make.
  Commit to your branches often and provide some detail to your changes.
